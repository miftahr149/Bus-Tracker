# Bus Tracker

## Getting Start with the Project

For this project, we are using Django framework. For the enviroment, we are using virtual enviroment. make sure you download it using this command on your terminal

```
pip install pipenv
```

You don't have to download Django because it's already in the virtual enviroment

if you want to run the project you can first access the virtual enviroment using:

```
pipenv shell
```

then if you already in the virutal enviroment, you can simply run the project using:
```
py manage.py runserver
```
